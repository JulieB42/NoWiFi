These are the code files for the "No WiFi? No Problem!" presentation. 

Alterative ways of speaking to your Arduino/ESP devices. 
WiFi is great for ESP32 and other devices. But what do you do if you're at a hotel or conference center? Wifi can be a mess, even if it's free.
So how do you get around public WiFi and roll your own? There are several ways of doing this with ESP32, one of which is ESP-Now. You can also use packet radio (like LoRa)
to communicate. 

My own specialty is lights and flashy blinky things, and this presentation will show a few examples. The code here supports that.
You can take this code and modify it freely.
